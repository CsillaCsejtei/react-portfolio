        With a decorated background in professional sports—including five
        Hungarian Boxing Championship titles, two European Boxing Championship
        bronze medals, and a European Kickboxing Championship bronze—I bring
        focus, resilience, and a strong work ethic to my career in tech. After
        transitioning from quality control in the vitamin manufacturing
        industry, I followed my long-standing passion for technology and
        graduated from SheCodes in May 2025 as a Front-End Developer. My studies
        have covered Python, AI, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, GitHub,
        Netlify, React, Axios, responsive design, and more. 
        I’m currently deepening my knowledge of back-end technologies through a full-stack
        bootcamp, where I’m learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, Node, Python,
        React, and deploying projects with Render—working toward becoming a
        full-stack developer who builds thoughtful, user-focused digital
        experiences.
